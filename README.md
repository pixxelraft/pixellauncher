# 🚀 PixelLauncher v1.0 — Your Personal Workspace Autopilot  
**Built by Umair (PixxelRaft) — All rights reserved**

PixelLauncher is a fully offline, PowerShell-based launcher that instantly opens all your essential tools, websites, folders, and projects — all in one go.

Think of it as a custom “Start Menu” for productivity.  
Build workspaces like:
- `Design Tools` → Opens all your design-related software & links  
- `Business` → Opens email, dashboards, and client folders  
Instead of launching things one-by-one, run one command — and boom, your entire environment is ready.

⚡ No installers.  
🚫 No background apps.  
✅ Just pure speed.
